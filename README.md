# SQL Querying

Employee data was provided for a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard.  Prior to analyzing the data, six tables were created within PostgreSQL to house the indivdual data sets.  Primary and foreign keys were defined to correlate column information that was shared between files.  The CSVs were then imported into each table to complete the schemata.

After data modeling, the employee informtion provided some details regarding departments, salaries, job titles, etc. from the 1980s and 1990s.  Several questions were analyzed to pare down the data by specific employee categories.  The schemata code can be viewed in the employee_schemata.sql file, and the specific queries that were analyzed are provided in the employee_queries.sql file.
